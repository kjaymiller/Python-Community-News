<p><small>Submitted by: <a href="https://api.github.com/users/jonafato">jonafato</a> on 2022-09-01T20:26:14Z</small></p>

<h3>DjangoCon Announces Weekly Twitter Spaces, Virtual Only Talks, and their COVID Policy</h3>

<p><small>Submitted by: <a href="https://api.github.com/users/kjaymiller">kjaymiller</a> on 2022-08-31T22:19:13Z</small></p>

<p>The DjangoCon US Organizers plan to hold weekly Twitter spaces leading up to their upcoming conference in October. During this space, lead by Django Events Foundation of North America board members and Conference planners, the team <a href="https://twitter.com/djangocon/status/1565025875904454656">announced</a> an in-person COVID policy, including mask and vaccine requirements. The mandate can be found at https://2022.djangocon.us/covid/.
Another topic that came out of the space was there would be exclusive talks given on the virtual platform.
Django Events Foundation of North America cofounder and former President Jeff Triplett gave us a statement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The online-only talks are extra content to fill in the gaps you feel more when you are watching remote than when you are at home. It's annoying to watch from home and have big 15 or 20 minute breaks between talk.</p>

<p><small>Submitted by: <a href="https://api.github.com/users/kjaymiller">kjaymiller</a> on 2022-08-30T06:37:21Z</small></p>

<p>The maintainer of Starlite made a plea to the community looking for maintainers and organizers. This seemed to receive positive feedback as many folks offered to help.
The maintainer claimed that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it's a core pillar of Starlite to have multiple maintainers and be as open, inviting and accessible for contributions as we can be.
  If you're interested in being a maintainer you can check out the request on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/wz07o3/starlite_is_looking_for_contributors_and/

<h3>Heroku ends free tier</h3>

<p><small>Submitted by: <a href="https://api.github.com/users/jonafato">jonafato</a> on 2022-08-26T17:47:10Z</small></p>

<p>Heroku is ending its free tier and plans to remove "inactive" accounts.</p>

<h3>Phishing attack targeting PyPI users</h3>

<p><small>Submitted by: <a href="https://api.github.com/users/jonafato">jonafato</a> on 2022-08-26T17:19:18Z</small></p>

<p>URL: https://twitter.com/pypi/status/1562442188285308929</p>

<p>A phishing attack has targeted maintainers of projects hosted on https://pypi.org. This attack comes less than two months after PyPI <a href="https://twitter.com/pypi/status/1545455297388584960">announced a plan</a> to require 2FA for "critical" packages. The PyPI admins have taken down malicious releases including several "typosquat" packages, and temporarily frozen affected maintainer accounts. Additionally, they have extended the <a href="https://pypi.org/security-key-giveaway/">2FA security key giveaway</a> to include eligible maintainers that already have TOTP-based 2FA enabled on their accounts. At the end of the Twitter thread, the PyPI team reminds users to contact <code>security@pypi.org</code> if they believe they have been targeted by a phishing attack.</p>

<h3>Pythonâ€™s still No. 1, but employers love to see SQL skills</h3>

<p><small>Submitted by: <a href="https://api.github.com/users/kjaymiller">kjaymiller</a> on 2022-08-26T15:58:45Z</small></p>

<p>URL: https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2022</p>

<p>Python's position w/e but I would like to learn more about why it's not as appealing as SQL/Java in job hunt, especially when we have solid ORMs. (The Java thing is just legacy IMHO)</p>
