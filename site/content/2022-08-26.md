A phishing attack has targeted maintainers of projects hosted on https://pypi.org. This attack comes less than two months after PyPI [announced a plan](https://twitter.com/pypi/status/1545455297388584960) to require 2FA for "critical" packages. The PyPI admins have taken down malicious releases including several "typosquat" packages, and temporarily frozen affected maintainer accounts. Additionally, they have extended the [2FA security key giveaway](https://pypi.org/security-key-giveaway/) to include eligible maintainers that already have TOTP-based 2FA enabled on their accounts. At the end of the Twitter thread, the PyPI team reminds users to contact `security@pypi.org` if they believe they have been targeted by a phishing attack.

Python's position w/e but I would like to learn more about why it's not as appealing as SQL/Java in job hunt, especially when we have solid ORMs. (The Java thing is just legacy IMHO)
