The Python Software Foundation announced on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ThePSF/status/1565415698100359169) they're running a Python Packaging Authority survey to "better understand the challenges and opportunities within the Python packaging ecosystem.".
The Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) is a working group that maintains a core set of software projects used in Python packaging.
The survey will close on Friday 30th September, 2022. Survey results will be published and shared with the community.
The PSF will publish a packaging vision and mission document informed by survey results.


### DjangoCon Announces Weekly Twitter Spaces, Virtual Only Talks, and their COVID Policy

<small>Submitted by: [kjaymiller](https://api.github.com/users/kjaymiller) on 2022-08-31T22:19:13Z</small>

The DjangoCon US Organizers plan to hold weekly Twitter spaces leading up to their upcoming conference in October. During this space, lead by Django Events Foundation of North America board members and Conference planners, the team [announced](https://twitter.com/djangocon/status/1565025875904454656) an in-person COVID policy, including mask and vaccine requirements. The mandate can be found at https://2022.djangocon.us/covid/.
Another topic that came out of the space was there would be exclusive talks given on the virtual platform.
Django Events Foundation of North America cofounder and former President Jeff Triplett gave us a statement.
> The online-only talks are extra content to fill in the gaps you feel more when you are watching remote than when you are at home. It's annoying to watch from home and have big 15 or 20 minute breaks between talk.

The maintainer of Starlite made a plea to the community looking for maintainers and organizers. This seemed to receive positive feedback as many folks offered to help.
The maintainer claimed that:
> it's a core pillar of Starlite to have multiple maintainers and be as open, inviting and accessible for contributions as we can be.
If you're interested in being a maintainer you can check out the request on [r/python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/wz07o3/starlite_is_looking_for_contributors_and/
